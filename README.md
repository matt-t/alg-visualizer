## Path Finder Visualizer

A responsive web app that visualizes the the nodes which get traversed to get from the start to finish later showing the shortest path to get from point A to B. Their is the added ability to place different types of walls (weighted or "real") which will also affect weighted search algorithms.

### Created Using:

HTML5, CSS3, React.js

Implemented Algortihms: Dijkstra

### Future Goals:

Implement more search algorithms like A* 
Add personalization:
  - Multiple grids to see multiple algorithms search paths at once
  - Add timer
Implement back-end using SQL to find common trends (fastest algorithm depending on how walls are placed)
